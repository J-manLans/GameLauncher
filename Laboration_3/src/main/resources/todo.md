Launcher
- Maybe a loading template for the launcher?
- Function to dynamically resize the launcher (Iâ€™m thinking of a listener for window resize and setting the preferred size as a function of the window size for the panels).

Games

**QUALITY OF LIFE IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- Nullify objects for controller, view, and model in the close method.

**BASIC GAME MECHANICS FOR SINGLE-PLAYER SNAKE:**
- *Listener for controls and direction function.*
- Collision handling (with itself and the edges).
- Randomizer to place food.
- Growth function.

**MENUS:**
- Settings, choose snake color.
- Start speed.
- Solid walls or not.
- Power-ups on or off, one for single-player and one for multiplayer (for single-player, it could be to slow down speed, bomb placement of food, etc.; for multiplayer, it could involve setting solid walls, slowing down, preventing food spawn, and increasing speed, etc.).
