Launcher


Games

Sure! Here’s the translation of your text into English:

---

**QUALITY OF LIFE IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- Nullify objects for controller, view, and model in the close method.
- Function to dynamically resize the launcher (I’m thinking of a listener for window resize and setting the preferred size as a function of the window size for the panels).
- Refactor SnakeView to maintain a card layout for the menus and then switch to GridBag for the game (one version for single-player and one for multiplayer). Perhaps have separate classes for all the panels, otherwise it might become a long class (the multiplayer should probably have its own menu where you can choose to play against the computer or a human).
- Maybe a loading template for the launcher?

**BASIC GAME MECHANICS FOR SINGLE-PLAYER SNAKE:**
- Listener for controls.
- Direction function.
- Collision handling (with itself and the edges).
- Randomizer to place food.
- Growth function.

**MENUS:**
- Settings, choose snake color.
- Start speed.
- Solid walls or not.
- Power-ups on or off, one for single-player and one for multiplayer (for single-player, it could be to slow down speed, bomb placement of food, etc.; for multiplayer, it could involve setting solid walls, slowing down, preventing food spawn, and increasing speed, etc.).
